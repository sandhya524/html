                <p>There are multiple matches for fecial, including a type of priest in ancient Rome and a variant spelling of the word "fetial": 
                    A type of priest in ancient Rome <br>
                    A fetial was a priest in ancient Rome who advised the Senate on foreign affairs and international treaties. They were also responsible for making formal declarations of war and peace, and confirming treaties. Fetials were part of a collegium dedicated to Jupiter, the patron of good faith.
                    A variant spelling of "fetial" <br>
                    "Fecial" is a variant spelling of the word "fetial". The word "fecial" comes from the Latin word fētiālis, which likely comes from the Old Latin word fētis, which means "treaty". 
                    A facial is a beauty treatment for the face that often involves cleansing, exfoliation, and massage.

                <p>Follow these tips from board-certified dermatologists to keep your hair healthy and looking good.

                    Learn your hair type. Whether you have curly, straight, coarse, fine, or another type of hair, there are products and routines that will work for you. Choose hair care products that say they’re made for your hair type.
                    
                    You may see hair types described by numbers and letters, going from fine, straight hair to thick, tightly coiled hair.
                    
                    Wash your hair based on how often it gets dirty or oily. If you have straight hair and an oily scalp, you may want to shampoo every day. If your hair is dry, textured, curly, or thick, shampoo when needed — at least once every 2 to 3 weeks as needed. If you see flakes in your hair, common reasons could be not shampooing frequently enough, or not using the right conditioner, oil, or scalp moisturizer for your hair type.
                    
                    Apply shampoo to your scalp, instead of the entire length of your hair. This way, you cleanse and wash away built-up products, dead skin, and excess oil, but avoid drying your hair too much.
                    
                    Use conditioner after washing your hair. Conditioner moisturizes and detangles your hair, and makes it easier to manage. If you have fine or straight hair, apply conditioner to the ends of your hair. However, if your hair is dry or curly, apply conditioner to the entire length of your hair.
                    
                    Be gentle with your hair. Hair is delicate when it’s wet, so use a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush to detangle wet hair. If you have thick, curly hair, the best time to comb is in the shower before rinsing out your conditioner. If you have straight hair, let your hair dry a bit before combing. Slowly comb the ends of your hair first then keep combing higher to detangle your hair with minimal damage.<a href="https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/hair-care-products-india-2025/" target="sandhya">See more..</a>

                <p>Cleansing: Cleansing your skin is the first step for any skincare routine, as it will remove any makeup, dirt, excess oils, and build-up on your skin. Double cleansing has become quite popular recently, where you use an oil-based cleanser to break down any makeup on your skin followed by foam or gel cleanser to remove everything. Those with dry skin should try not to go overboard as it can rip your skin of natural oils when using a hard cleanser.

                    Toning: Toner helps achieve the skin's pH balance. You can either spritz a mild toner on your face or take a small amount on a cotton pad and swipe it all over the face. A good toner tightens pores over regular use and lends an enviable glow to your skin.</p>
